        <h1>Period 2.3</h1>
        <p>1. What was a "Joint Stock Company"? 

A company where people invest in the ventures of exploration and then reap their share of the benefits and dilute the risk. This form of funding was neccicary because Britain did not have large funds like Spain, France, or the Dutch.

2. How did the cultivation of tobacco change Jamestown and how it funtioned? 

Tobacco allowed people to labor to plant it in return for passage to the colonies with no need for large sums of money. The downside was that they needed more land to plant the increased demand for tobacco which caused them to approach the natives and war with them over said land. The Governor did not want to war with the natives so the farmers revolted in Bacon’s Rebellion. The uprising was squashed, but the nobles worried that there may be more as the indentured servants outnumbered the nobles by a large amount. They began to seek a new form of labor that turned out to be enslaved Africans.

3. Who were the Puritans? Why did they settle in North America? 

The puritans were a religious sect of Christianity that moved to the new world to get land to farm as persecution did not occur where they lived, but there was not much land there either. They settled in 1620, making a settlement for fellow puritans to escape persecution and or get more land.</p>
