        <h1>Period 1.4</h1>
        <p>1. What was the "Columbian Exchange"? 

The Colombian Exchange was the exchange of food, animals, minerals, people, and diseases between Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

2. How did the exchange of disease change the Americas?

The exchange of disease, mainly smallpox, caused most of the natives to die. This gave the Spanish the ability to conquer large civilizations with a small army.

3. How did the exchange of food change the Americas? 

High yeild crops were exported from the Americas. Grains and other crops were imported from Europe and Africa. The grains became staple food crops in the Americas. Pigs and cattle vastly changed the natives diet and horses drastically changed warfare for the natives.

4. How did the exchange change the economy of Europe? 

Spain became very wealthy as a result of conquering the natives and plundering their gold. Feudalism was phasing out and large amounts of gold allowed for capitalism to explode across Europe.</p>
