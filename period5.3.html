<h1>Mecixan-American War</h1>
<p>Mexico won a revolution to take their land from Spain. Steven F. Austin leads 300 families into Texas. They were expected to follow Mexican laws, citizens, convert to catholocisim, limited immagrartion, slavery outlawed in 1829, and increased tax in 1830. Send Steven to negotiate. Government arrests him for 18 months, comes back and war broke out. 13 day seige on the alamo where everyone inside was killed, take cannons, Sam Houston used the alamo defeat to rally the troups and defeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna captured hiding in a swamp ending thw war. Texas is free. Feels similar to American revolutin which gained help from SOME Americans. Mexico sees this as a proxy war. In 1845 Texas becomes the 28th state. British funded Mexicans to fight Americans (another proxy war). Cosied up with Texas by recognizing it as a country. Eventually annexed Texas after 8 years.</p>
<h2>Post m-a war</h2>
<p>Texas though Rio Grande Mexico thought the border was on the Nueces river. Land dispute. 30 mil offered and declined heavily. General Zachary Taylor sent with an army to the disputed land. Two armies fight and America declared war. American blood on American soil. Sketchy circumstances. 1/5 Times where US actually declares war. Rush into California and Nevada areas where the US navy and soildiers took the land. March soildiers to Mexico city to siege it and degrade the governement. Many Generals of the Civil War trained up by the Mexican American war. Treaty gained 525,000 SQ MI for the US. 5 states. $15 million for the deal. Whig party deems it an unconstitutional land grab. Wihg party started it. Whig party dies off. Seen as a way to spread slavery.</p>
