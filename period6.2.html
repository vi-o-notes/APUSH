    <h1>Trans-continental and westward expansion</h1>
    <h2>TRAINS</h2>
    <h3>Trains in 1830</h3>
    <p>Small amounts of roads, trains, and canals</p>
    <h3>Trains in 1840</h3>
    <p>More roads and railroads are very small and not connected to other railways, all in North and near ports.</p>
    <h3>Trains in 1860</h3>
    <p>Rails branch west FINALLY. They connct together now. Still in East. Everyone wanted railroads in their town becaause of the profits it brought. People bought mass land to try to industrialize.</p>
    <h3>Trains in 1869</h3>
    <p>RAIL MEETS. Now goes from East to West and meet at Promontory Point UT. Final golden spike was put in and taken out to commence the railroad. Rushed because of government payout per mile, snakey and badly built for the most miles possible.</p>
    <h2>Economics</h2>
    <p>Railroad finished and now lots of western resources could be moved east to factories. Peoplpe could access goods from anywhere to wherever they were. Sent battle veterans to build railroads after civil war, newly freed slaved and immigrants worked on the railroads. Brought everyone together. Army strategists now were able to conviene and make the railroad for logistics. Sold to Union Pacific and Central Pacific who were paid by the mile for 2000 miles of track by the government.</p>
    <h2>Expansion</h2>
    <p>Americans flock to mine. Farmers flock west to farm. Cattle farming grows(Enourmously). Rail allowed all of this. Barbed wire invented to secure farms. COW THEFT!</p>
