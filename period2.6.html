        <h1>Period 2.6</h1>
        <p>1. How and why did "Bacon's Rebellion" change the way labor was sourced in the British colonies? 

Bacon’s rebellion occurred because. The enslaved Africans and the endentured servants rose up together. The seen solution to this by the nobles was to rely only on African slavery to prevent further uprising.

2. How was slave labor distributed throughout the British colonies? 

In the far north in New England, there were few enslaved people, as the farms were smaller and there was less of a need for labor there. In the large port cities like New York, there were many enslaved people because they were used as dock workers and many other tasks that needed a large amount of labor to conduct. In the southern colonies there were many more slaves because of the large farms and large labor needs all throughout those areas and not just a few cities. The British West Indies had more slavers even then the South. The trend becomes that the farther south in the colonies, the more enslaved people there will be.

3. What were examples of "slave laws" within the British colonies?

African slaves were legally defined as property or a domesticated animal in trade. Slavery was perpetual and passed from one generation to the next. The laws got harsher as time went on, one example was slave owners being allowed to kill their slaves for defiance of orders.

4. What are examples of both "covert" and "overt" forms of slave resistance in the British colonies? 

Enslaved people covertly practiced cultural customs and maintained beliefs or spoke native languages and kept naming practices from their homeland, some would break tools and damage crops without the owners noticing. The overt rebellion involved acts like rising up and killing people to stop them from enslaving more people.
