        <h1>Period 1.5</h1>
        <p>1. Describe how the African slave trade developed under the Europeans.
	
	Slaves had rights and were usually captured prisoners or payment and slavery was not permanent nor inherited. All this changed with the Europeans when they started trading Africans into slavery in exchange for goods at forts along the coast of Africa.

2. Describe how the native slave systems developed in the New World under the Spanish.

A person would be granted land and all the natives on it to then farm that land or mine or other tasks.

3. Describe the "caste system" 
The Spanish needed to tax the new world and because the Spanish taxed those who were at the bottom of the social ladder the most, they needed to know the order of people. They decided on a racial-ancestry based system of hierarchy. Peninsulares were those born in Spain on the Iberian peninsula.  Criollos were next, and they were Spanish born in the Americas. Then it was Mestizos who were people of Spanish and Native ancestry. Then mulattoes were people of Spanish and African ancestry. Then the Africans and then lastly the Native Americans.</p>
