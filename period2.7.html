        <h1>Period 2.7</h1>
        <p>1. What was the "Elightenment"?

The enlightenment was the era where people began to ponder what a government does and should be allowed to do, people began to realize that monarchies and feudalism did not allow for much to happen or for people to be happy.

2. What are "natural rights"?

Natural rights ae the given rights that every single person has. The rights to life, liberty, and property. These rights became a thing to protect to make a government suitable for people to live under.

3. What is a "social contract" between people and their government?

It is a bond where the people obey the laws and support the country and give the government power to in return receive protection from their government and retain their natural rights.

4. What was the "Great Awakening"? How did the elightenment lead to the "Great Awakening"?

The great awakening was the mass revival of religion all over the colonies that included mixing religion with the new knowledge of the enlightenment. This was caused by the enlightenment because people started to believe that their senses collect information and that knowledge starts with discovery, but this undermined religions where everything started with god.

5. How did the Elightenment and Great Awakening come together to create a unique American view on being a British colony?Â 

The enlightenment made people question the authority of the king and the great awakening causes people to realize the democratic teachings of the Bible. These combined to make the colonists realize that the king should be relplaced with a vote based democracy which would be better in all ways for the people. The colonies were bound together by these shared ideaologies and became newly aware of the option to revolt and become their own country, free from Britain and its king.
