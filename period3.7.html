            <h1>3.7 Artiicles of Confederation</h1>
            <h4>Loose Confederation</h4>
            <p>Ben Franklin wrote first verison and Silas Deane submitted his version later in 1775. These gave congress power to make treaties alliances and maintain armed forces. They could coin money, make postal service, and sole states disputes. States retain soverignty, freedom, and independance. <strong>"A firm league of friendship."</strong></p>
            <h4>Large Disputes</h4>
            <p>States dispute of where the U.S. stops and why Virginia is <strong>SO LARGE</strong></p>
            <h4>The Articles are Weak</h4>
            <p>The soildiers wanted to be paid so they trapped congress in Independance Hall. Congress had no ability to call military. <strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong> calmed the soildiers down.</p>
            <h4>Congress Needs its own State</h4>
            <h5>Residance Act is passed</h5>
            <h6>1790</h6>
            <h7>Established Washington D.C.</h7>
            <p>Part of Vrginia and Maryland is cut to make the capitol and its city.</p>
            <h4>Probblems With Articles of Confederation</h4>
            <p>Final document is debated by congress and sent to be ratified in 1777.</p>
            <h3>1779</h3>
            <p>All states but maryland have raified. Virginia yields land claims to the west to calm Maryland and ratify the articles.</p>
            <h4>The Articles (Again)</h4>
            <p>Can't force states to do anything. <br></br> Lack power over commerce. <br></br> Gov. couldn't collect taxes. <br></br> Lacked judiciary and executive branches. <br></br> They could only ask for taxes, causing congress to be bankrupt. <br></br> Each state had a vote and needed 9/13 to ratify anthing. <br></br> <i>John Dickenson proposed taxes based off of population.</i></p>
