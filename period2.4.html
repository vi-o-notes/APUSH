        <h1>Period 2.4</h1>
        <p>1. What was the "triangular trade" and how did it function?

Merchant ships followed a three-part travel triangle to trade goods for a profit. The first leg of the triangle was from New England for example and carry a product to West Africa to trade it for enslaved peoples. The next leg involved going back to the British West Indies to trade the enslaved people for a product, often sugarcane, and then heading back to their port of origin.

2. What was the idea of "favorable balance of trade" in a mercantilist system? 

There is a limited amount of gold and silver in the world, so trading evenly means that the limited amount is never locked up in specific place and instead is forced to move around.

3. What role did colonies play in a mercantilist system? How did the "Navigation Acts" play a role in maintaining that system?

Colonies gave merchants resources that they could not find in their own country and in exchange colonies had gold to buy resources that they needed and couldn’t produce themselves. The navigation acts required English colonies to be traded to exclusively on English ships, valuable items also needed to be brought through British ports where they could be taxed. This kept trade occurring between the colonies and Britain and maintained the merchantilist trade circle in the colonies.

4. How did the "consumer revolution" change society? 

With the boost of trade ability and wealth, more people were able to buy many goods, people became larger scale consumers. This caused society in general to end up with more goods and people bought a lot more stuff.</p>
