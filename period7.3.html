    <h2>Spanish-American War</h2>
    <p>Cuba was a Spanish colony that grew suar. Spainish were becoming poor. Cuba revolts against Spain. 200,000 cubans die. Concentration camps and "the butcher", General Valeriano Weyler. US helps the rebellion. American buisiness in Cuba in danger (90% of cuban exports to US, 40% of US export to Cuba). USS Maine parked in Havana harbor explodes. News shapes narratives of the war and got filthy rich over it. Sensational Yellow Journalism. News shapes image to make everyone able to read news. 3 months, 3 weeks, and 2 days. US destroed Spanish; "Splended Little War" steel warships vs wooden ships, 1 heat exaustion death for US (0 to Spain and entire Spanish. fleet defeated).</p>
