<h2>Lincoln</h2>
<p>mother died when he was young. Self taught and got into politics with whigs. Eulogy at Henrty Clay's funeral. Debate with Steven Douglas over slavery. Popular soverignty decided. Slave states hated it. Lincoln's plan was to stop slavery where it is and new territories would not have them. This plan unballances the system and really pissed off southerners. Lincoln gained fame from the debates. Wilmont Proviso made the idea of stopping slavery. Fugitivee slave law added because of the redrawing of slavery lines with popular soverighnty. Kansas-Nebraska act remakes MO compromise and fuels the South.</p>
