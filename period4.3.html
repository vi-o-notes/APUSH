            <h1>4.3 Politics and Regional Differences</h1>
            <p>Dabate over tarrifs, mercantilism, agriculture vs industry. Merchants live in large cities in NE vs farmers in rural areas, South. Large economy is unimportant to rural farmers with small markets. Tarrifs are problematic. American system developed pushed by Henry Clay and the Whigs to allow for farmers to indulge in trade and development of many transport systems and pushes the government to build roads with tax funds. Industrialists love terrifs, farmers hate them. Country begins to divide over policy and especially slavery.</p>
