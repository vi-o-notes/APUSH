        <h1>Period 2.2</h1>
        <p>1. Describe the Spanish colonial efforts in North America. 

The Spanish gained wealth by farming the colonies for natural resources and agriculture, all with slave labor. The attempt at enslaving the natives to work failed, so the Spanish instead inslaved African peoples and shipped them to the colonies to do work. They then built a caste system based on racial ancestry, and converted as many natives as possible to Christianity. Some accepted it, some accepted it and continued their prior practices, and others revolted against the Spanish.

2. Describe the French colonial efforts in North America.

The French finally joined in on sailing west to find a colony in 1524. The French wanted to find a water route through the Americas to trade in Asia, but they were tied up in wars in Europe and busy with persecuting the Protestants. In 1608, after not finding a water route to Asia, the French decided to settle a colony anyway. So Samuel Champlain founded the settlement of Quebec. The French were more into trade than conquering and trade furs and fish. The French did not make many colonies, they had many trading settlements and the permanent city of Quebec.

3. Describe the Dutch colonial efforts in North America.

The Dutch went to find a water route to Asia, also unsuccessfully, and instead in 1624 made a settlement by the name of New Amsterdam, later New York. New Amsterdam became a trading hub because of its sea access and attracted traders in the area. The Dutch did not care at all about spreading their religion, Protestantism, and instead just focused on the profits.

4. Describe the British colonial efforts in North America. 

The English needed money and the nobles got poor after warring with the French too much. The peasants also experienced hardship from land loss. England needed money and land, which was in the new world, so they settled. The English had no large civilizations nearby and were peaceful with the natives briefly before eventual war.</p>
