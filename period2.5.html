        <h1>Period 2.5</h1>
        <p>1. What was the "Pueblo Revolt"? How was the Pueblo revolt a result of the Spanish style of native interaction? 

The Pueblo revolt was a revolt by the Pueblo people on the Spanish. This occurred because the Spanish used very intrusive measures to inflict Christianity onto the native peoples, causing the Pueblo to revolt and purge the Spanish off their lands.

2. What was "Metacom's War"? How was the war a result of the English style of native interactions? 

The English peacefully traded and shared ideas with the natives until they needed more land when they began to encroach on the natives land. The natives saw this as an attack on their way of life and attacked the colonists to attempt to force them out. The colonists responded with having their native allies attack and kill the main native leader, stopping the resistance alltogether. 

3. How did the French interact with the Native Americans? 

The French were much less invasive and instead traded with and married the natives to be on good trading terms. The French also allied with the natives to fight other natives or whatever war needed help in. </p>
